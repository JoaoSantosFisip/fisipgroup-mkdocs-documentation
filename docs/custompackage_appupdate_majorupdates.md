# Major Updates

Whenever we have a update that contains big changes that we feel the need to have every player at, we set it as `Major`.

## How to set an update as Major
1. Go to [Unity Cloud](https://cloud.unity.com) and go to the `Remote Config` section.
2. Select the right `Environment`.
3. Find the variable with the name `MajorVersions`.
4. On the `versions` array, add the number of the apps version you want to set as major.

For `Major Updates` to work properly its required that both platforms have the same versions, since these values will apply for both platforms.
