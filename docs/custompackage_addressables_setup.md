## Requirements
- Unity Services account.
- Be a member of the FisipGroup organization and have `Manager` permissions. (Permissions might need necessary, confirm pls)
- Add dependency packages:
    - Addressables.

More info on how to add custom packages here:  [Add package from git URL](https://joaosantosfisip.github.io/fisipgroup-mkdocs-documentation/custompackage_guide_giturl/);

## Set recommended settings
To make sure the addressables work properly we recommend using the recommended settings.
