# Custom Packages
## About
To help on the development of the games several `Custom Packages` were created to speed up the development process and remove the need to develop the same thing twice.

All the developed custom packages repo's can be found here: [Github Repositories](https://github.com/JoaoSantosFisip?tab=repositories&q=fisipgroup-custom-package-&type=&language=&sort=)

## How to add custom packages
1. On the unity project go to `Window -> Package Manager`.
2. Press the plus sign on the top left of the window and select `Add package from git URL...`.
